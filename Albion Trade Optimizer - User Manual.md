## Crafting Optimizer

The Crafting Optimizer helps you determine the most profitable approach for obtaining items: buying directly from the market, crafting from raw materials, or using a hybrid strategy.

### How It Works

The optimizer analyzes three strategies for each item:

1. **Buy Strategy**: Purchase the finished item directly from the market
2. **Craft Strategy**: Buy raw materials and craft the item yourself
3. **Hybrid Strategy**: Craft some materials, buy others based on cost efficiency

### Key Factors Considered

#### Crafting Costs
- **Raw Materials**: Current market prices for all required resources
- **Station Fees**: Crafting station taxes and usage fees
- **Focus Costs**: Premium focus point requirements and returns
- **Time Investment**: Crafting time and opportunity costs

#### Market Conditions
- **Material Availability**: Stock levels and price stability
- **Finished Item Demand**: Market depth and competition
- **Price Volatility**: Recent price trends and fluctuations
- **Regional Differences**: Price variations between cities

#### Item Analysis

1. **Select Item**: Choose the item you want to analyze
2. **Set Quantity**: Specify how many units you need
3. **Choose City**: Select your crafting location
4. **Configure Options**: Set focus usage, station preferences

#### Strategy Comparison

The optimizer will show:

- **Total Cost**: Complete cost for each strategy
- **Time Required**: Crafting time vs. immediate purchase
- **Profit Potential**: If crafting for sale rather than personal use
- **Risk Assessment**: Market volatility and material availability
- **Recommendation**: Best strategy based on your criteria

#### Advanced Options

- **Focus Usage**: Enable/disable premium focus point consumption
- **Resource Return**: Account for crafting resource return rates
- **Station Bonuses**: Include crafting station quality bonuses
- **Bulk Discounts**: Consider volume pricing for large orders

### Crafting Strategies

#### Pure Crafting
- Craft all materials from basic resources
- Highest time investment, potentially highest profits
- Best for items with expensive finished products

#### Smart Hybrid
- Buy cheap materials, craft expensive ones
- Balance time investment with cost savings
- Optimal for most crafting scenarios

#### Market Timing
- Craft when materials are cheap
- Sell when finished products are expensive
- Requires market knowledge and patience

### Profitability Analysis

#### Break-Even Calculation
The optimizer calculates:
- **Material Costs**: Total cost of all required resources
- **Crafting Fees**: Station taxes and usage costs
- **Opportunity Cost**: Value of time spent crafting
- **Market Price**: Current selling price of finished item

#### Profit Margins
- **Gross Profit**: Revenue minus direct costs
- **Net Profit**: Gross profit minus opportunity costs
- **ROI**: Return on investment percentage
- **Profit per Hour**: Efficiency metric for time investment

### Best Practices

1. **Monitor Material Prices**: Track resource costs over time
2. **Plan Ahead**: Consider crafting during low-demand periods
